About Myself
======
I am currently a PhD Candidate at Singapore's [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/eee) (NTU), under the supervision of [Professor Xie Lihua](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/elhxie/). I received my B.Eng with honors from the [Faculty of Electrical and Electronics Engineering](http://dee.hcmut.edu.vn/index.php?route=common/home) (FEEE) at [Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology](https://hcmut.edu.vn/en) (HCMUT) in 2017. 
My research interests include Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), perception and localization for robotics, specifically for Micro-Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) and automated guided vehicles (AGVs). I am reachable at [thienhoangnguyen94@gmail.com](mailto:thienhoangnguyen94@gmail.com).

**Description**: A comprehensive optimization-based estimator for the 15-D state of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), fusing data from an extensive set of sensors: inertial measurement unit (IMU), ultrawideband (UWB) ranging sensors, and multiple onboard visual-inertial and lidar odometry subsystems, referred to as VIRAL (visual-inertial-ranging-lidar) SLAM.

**Description**: A datasets collected from our research Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platform, featuring an extensive set of sensors:
- Two 3D LiDARs (Ouster OS1-16 gen 1)
- Two time-synchronized cameras (uEye 1221 LE)
- Multiple IMUs (VectorNav VN100 and Ouster's IMUs)
- Four Ultra-wideband (UWB) nodes on UAV, ranging to three anchor nodes (Humatic P440)
- 3-DoF ground truth obtained from Leica MS60 TotalStation.

The comprehensive sensor suite resembles that of an autonomous driving car, but features distinct and challenging characteristics of aerial operations. The flight tests are conducted in a variety of both indoor and outdoor conditions.
